The game is in a 'playable' state on the board game arena developer website, with the following issues left to be fixed:

1)board rotation/player perspective - board currently is only viewable from 'white' players perspective, suggested fix is to use view.php to change the board piece reference setup depending on the player.

2)minimize the piece selection area some to fit the 1024 pixel screen width limit

3)replace the piece orientation selection area with possibly two separate representative icons

4)In it's current state, the scoring is also off by 1 point as well(1 - 100 instead of 0-99 points)
